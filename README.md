# Saqr
Saqr is a real-time license plate recognition system designed to detect stolen or wanted cars. Utilizing a YOLOv8 model deployed on a Raspberry Pi with a camera, the system captures live video feeds and accurately recognizes license plates. This project supports both Arabic and English characters, making it particularly suitable for Saudi plates.
